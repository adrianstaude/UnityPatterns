Behavioral Patterns(Patterns to control object behavior)

STRATEGY PATTERN

Usage:
- Attaching behavioral components/algorithms onto Objects on runtime

Pros:
- Fewer condition statements, since each behavior has its own component
- Alternative to subclassing: No hardwiring behaviors in each subclass(?)

Cons:
- No abstraction from Client, so client has to know the various strategies
- Increased Code Complexity
